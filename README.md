Implement object manipulation per the above spec, meeting the following requirements:

- Translation, rotation, and scaling of object on x, y, z axes via gimbal controls and mouse click
    - Note - your build does not need to work in XR
- Any mesh is acceptable i.e. the standard Unity cube is fine
- The gimbal handles do not need to aesthetically match the above spec. Colors / materials are irrelevant and placeholder meshes are fine
- The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability to code functionality - not aesthetics or animations - in a polished manner as well as document your work effectively
